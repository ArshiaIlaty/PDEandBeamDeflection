## Problem 1: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
(a) Elliptic Equation with Neumann Boundary Condition

Steps:

	1.	Discretize the Domain: Divide the interval [0, \frac{\pi}{2}] into smaller subintervals (elements). For simplicity, use uniform discretization.
	2.	Weak Formulation: Multiply the equation by a test function v and integrate over the domain. Apply integration by parts to handle the Neumann boundary conditions.
	3.	Assemble System of Equations: After discretizing the weak form using the finite element basis functions, this will result in a system of linear equations, KU = F, where K is the stiffness matrix, U is the vector of unknowns, and F is the force vector.
	4.	Neumann Conditions: Incorporate the Neumann boundary conditions by adjusting the corresponding entries in the vector F.
	5.	Solve the System: Use MATLAB’s linear solver (\ or linsolve) to solve for U.

 (b) Non-Homogeneous Diffusion Equation

Steps:

 	1.	Discretize Time and Space: Use finite differences for time discretization and finite elements for space discretization. For the time discretization, use an implicit scheme like backward Euler for stability.
	2.	Weak Formulation for Spatial Part: For each time step, solve the weak form of the spatial equation.
	3.	System of Equations: At each time step, solve the system K U^{n+1} = F^{n+1}, where K is the spatial stiffness matrix and U^{n+1} is the solution vector at the new time step.
	4.	Initial Condition: Begin with the initial condition u(x, 0) = 0.
	5.	Solve for Each Time Step: Iterate over time steps, solving the system at each step.

 ## Problem 2: Beam Deflection using MFET

 1.	Solve for M:
	•	Solve the second equation M{\prime}{\prime} = 1 with the boundary conditions M(0) = M(1) = 0.
	•	Use MFET to solve this second-order equation, which will yield M(x).

2.	Solve for u:
	•	Once you have M(x), solve the first equation u{\prime}{\prime} = M with boundary conditions u(0) = u(1) = 0 using MFET.
	•	This will give you u(x), the deflection of the beam.
